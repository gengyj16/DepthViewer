- 3D Effect Rendering: Create a 3D effect from the uploaded image and depth map.
- Interactive View Control: Enable interactive 3D view control via mouse or touch on PC and mobile.
- View Angle Limiter: Limit the maximum movable view angle to ensure good preview effect and avoid distortion.

## Style Guidelines:

- Primary color: Desaturated blue (#79A7D3) to create a calm and focused environment for image viewing.
- Background color: Very light desaturated blue (#F0F4F8) to keep the focus on the 3D render.
- Accent color: Desaturated purple (#9979D3) to complement the primary color while providing distinction for interactive elements.
- Body and headline font: 'Inter' (sans-serif) for a clean, modern, and readable UI.
- Use a clean and minimalist layout to keep the focus on the image and depth map. Controls should be intuitive and unobtrusive.
- Incorporate subtle transitions and animations for a smoother user experience when navigating and interacting with the 3D view.
